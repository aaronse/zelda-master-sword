My college kid wants me to print one. Cool, but... I want to teach them time and materials aren't free, also, designers of IP should get rewarded, so the designers are incentivized to make more cool stuff. Am charging my kid 50% of cheapest price they can find for 3D printed part service.\n\nIf you're ok with this use of your design, I'd like to do a video of the process.

The issue with friction fit parts is that every printer prints slightly different. If I designed the parts with your printer's tolerances in mind, they might be a perfect fit for you, but some other printers would print parts that fit way too loose. These files should work for you, but they might require glue.\n\n‚Äähttps://www.printables.com/model/318214-loz-botw-master-sword-alternative-pieces-with-loos\n\n Reply  June 2 at 6:47 PM\n15\nEmpyrean3D\n@Empyrean3D\n\nSuch a fun project.

Took 1 day 6 hours and 45 minutes to print at .2 mm layer height. Filaments used were CC3D Silk Royal Blue PLA, HP3DF Silk Green PLA, GIANTARM Silk Metallic Silver PLA, and Amazon Basics Silk PLA Gold. The blue of the scabbard is Elegoo Dark Blue PLA. I specifically purchased each color for the print as they most closely matched what I felt the master sword has always looked like. It should be a very blue, slight purple color. The images don't actually do the color of the blue justice. It is as close as any I've ever seen.\n\nUsed the remixed canonical "Cross Guard Ultimate" crossguard to get a more correct look.\n\nDEFINITELY follow comment suggestions to resize Guard Pins to 99%. I broke several of them, being unable to hammer them in. After reprinting damaged parts and resizing the pins to 99%. They were still snug as they should be, but hammered in easily.

Just wondering what the length of the finished product is. Also, is the hilt/handle easy to grip or does it slip around in your hand? One of the problems with a round hilt is that the sword would change directions and slide around while in your hand.

Working on a blue and gold version next. Just waiting on filament.\n\nAll of the handle pieces were printed at 100% infill. All blade pieces were printed at 20% with gyroid infill (had trouble with cubic infill knocking the blade off the plate halfway through).\n\nAlso ended up printing the pommel ring from @sgaon_272296 to help hold it on. Works and looks great.\n\nP.S. If anyone is interested, I think a remix with the blade width being reduced to the width of piece one (while keeping the triforce piece) would be cool. Would also make it lighter and easier to wield while also keeping a dense infill for strength. I tried but Im new to 3D design and its a bit out of my wheel house.

I decided to reprint using silk PLA; the parts looked amazing separately, but were WAY too hard to put together due to the nature of the silk filament. I even manually scaled all of the pieces down a half percent each as I went down the blade, but to no avail. I'm going to give it a third try with the modified parts that Popandsicle posted and see how that goes.

One of the blade sections fell down in the middle of the print, and instead of printing the parts again, I measured how much was printed, and I cut the sections in the slicer program and continued printing. What I didn't realize is the blade is tapered from beginning to end and I needed to pay attention to the order of blade sections because they didn't fit quite right.\n\nThe overall design is really good, except there are a couple of places where improvements could be made. I practically destroyed this thing getting it together because there is little to no tolerance between the male and female parts. The male parts need to be reduced by 5%, so I ended up sanding every one down to get things to fit, ESPECIALLY the blade joiner. That one was a nightmare and I ended up giving up before it turned into shrapnel. I ended up filling the void with acrylic (see photo) and repairing everything else with more acrylic. The guard pin broke twice so I ended up adhering it with more acrylic.\n\nThe end result was acceptable, but not what I envisioned or hoped for.\n\n Reply  May 30, 2024 at 12:10 PM\nPrusa MK4\n9\nGiZmO -San\n@GiZmOSan_380845\n Reply  1 like May 16, 2024 at 2:38 PM\nCreality Ender 3 V2\n9\ndylan shields\n@dylanshields_1329313\n\nThis was my first proper test I did when I got my 3d printer.

It‚Äôs very difficult designing 3D printed parts that are meant to friction fit together because not all printers print exactly the same, not all filament share the same qualities. If I designed the parts so they were a perfect fit for you, they would be too loose of a fit for many others. If you‚Äôre really convinced the sword is impossible to assemble, I urge you to refer to the over 400 images posted of fully assembled swords from other users.\n\n Reply  1 like March 8, 2024 at 4:51 PM\n17\nMONSTER MUSKIE\n@MonsterMuskie\n Reply  1 like February 26, 2024 at 5:26 PM\nPrusa MK4\n15\nUpendragon\n@Upendragon_282706\n\nGreat print.

I am so thankful for this! after about 40 hours of printing and some work, it's all in one piece. I used Link's model for the wings. some pieces were a tight fit, especially the blade. some were too loose. Just had to sand and glue to get it together. In hindsight, I should have printed the looser tolerance pieces for the blade, but I got it together. A few of the pieces broke while assembling (Hilt Anchor and Grip), and I believe it was my fault for not using enough infill. Just printed them again with more infill. Maybe if the Hilt Anchor went farther into the Grip it would be stronger? I should have printed all the pieces with more infill anyway. Kind of worried it's too fragile, I'm just going to be careful with it. Anyways, this is amazing.

At 60%, if it dropped, which my toddler would repeatedly do on accident, the blade would just snap.\n\n Reply  January 30, 2024 at 5:43 PM\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@Jtgott317_553764 I love the idea, but for it to be effective I'd want the dowel to run all the way to the pommel, which would require a major redesign.

I also trimmed the long part of the guard pins by 3/4 of it's length to make it easier to push in.

The only way to appreciate how cool the design is is to print it yourself. I printed the non adhesion assisted versions, and used glue sticks to make it stick to the bed. That worked really well. The tolerances are really tight, and for some pieces I had to use a rubber mallet and/or sanding to make the pieces fit, but this was mostly because I wanted the model to hold together as well as possible, otherwise I would have printed the looser blade pieces.\n\nNow I‚Äôm going to self advertise a little bit, sorry. If you look at the pictures, you might notice that my wings are longer than the standard ones. The standard versions fit on a Prusa Mini, and that‚Äôs super convenient for those with just a Prusa Mini, but the wings just aren‚Äôt as long as they should be. So I made a remix, to make the wings to look like they do in the game. If at all possible, you should print my version of the wings instead, because it‚Äôll look a lot more correct. https://www.printables.com/model/555004-master-sword-zelda-zelda-zelda-master-sword-remix-\nBut either way, this is definitely my favorite model I‚Äôve ever printed, and I highly recommend it.\n\n Reply  September 3, 2023 at 6:24 AM\nPrusa MK3/S/S+\n1\nPla Mor\n@KilbertVilleg_354971\n\nI made it and painted it as best as possible to match the color accurately.

Great printing, easy assembly, looks great, feels much sturdier than others I've made (save for the one with the aluminum rod, but assembly much easier than that one).\n\nOne thing I was not ready for was the size of the sword. It's huge! The pictures were a bit deceiving, so I included one for others with a standard can for comparison. I'm impressed that you made this so big and yet I could print each piece with my Prusa MINI+.\n\nI did 0.2 layer height and 15% infill. With past issues printing taller prints, I lowered the print speed for anything over 30, especially travel for non-print moves (150 to 70). I have found the "jutting" of the print bed caused the tall prints to unstick from the bed. I did use the adhesion assisted models though, which also helped.\n\nI only had a couple of issues with assembly. One was the pin of the pommel not holding both halves tight, so I added a touch of super glue gel that I can pry apart later if desired. The other issue was the guard pin sliding in. I had to cut the width down a few mm from the long insert part in order to get it to slide all the way in (still hard to push in). Other than that, it was great.\n\nThanks so much for your hard work!

The hilt went together pretty well, if a bit tight. However, the blade pieces just will not fit together at all. Perhaps it's because I'm using a silk PLA silver filament, but there's just no way they will combine without shaving off a millimeter from the "tabs." I guess I'll have to finally figure out how to use my Dremel soon, and I hope I don't screw it up.\n\nIn addition, the sword tip has an odd shape visible on the outside that matches the inner hollow area (see attached picture). My guess is that the silk PLA is causing this somehow. So I might try using PrusaSlicer to fill those hollow areas since I won't need them anyway and see if that makes a difference.\n\n Reply  July 18, 2023 at 10:40 AM\nPrusa MK3/S/S+\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@Sturm There's looser fitting alternative versions of all the parts in the remixes section for the sword for anyone with fit issues.\n\n Reply  1 like July 18, 2023 at 10:53 AM\nE\n4\nEngezerstorung\n@Engezerstoru_1048951\n\nFirst and foremost, thank you for this model, truly amazing to build !\nMade with transparent pla on someone else work printer when they had available time.\nAt first i just wanted to do some test to see if i could print it before investing in colored filaments but i ended up being carried away !\nI plan to print another one with my own printer and filaments.\n\nTo finish, while i have some niptick on esthetic design choices related to accuracy (which doesnt really tarnish the love i have for it overall), I have two suggestion on the more technical design concerning the pommel :\n\n1/ the major one : it keep separating, and while glue is an option, it could have been nice to have it being kept closed with a ring like the guard does\n\n2/ the minor one : i had almost a 1mm gap between the pommel and the handle core piece bottom (due to tolerances i guess), while i managed to close it by sanding on one side and adding on the other, it could have been nice to have the pommel parts have a "lip" coming over the handle to make up for this kind of potential issue (again, like it does for the guard side)\n\nThank you again for the amazing model !

I still have some gaps between handle and pommel parts, so I might want to reprint them in a far future with better compensation settings in my slicer. But since I plan to have it hang on a wall most of the time, it's not such a burning issue.\n\n Reply  1 like July 7, 2023 at 4:37 AM\nCreality Ender 3 V2 Neo\n14\nFuncrusher\n@Funcrusher_2990\n\nAmazing model, especially paired with the scabbard.

Only tough bit was inserting the final guard pins, where the tight tolerances and thinness of the part that gets inserted means that it got stuck and bent before being inserted all the way. I ended up snipping the guard pins to leave only the outer embellishments, and glued them on instead.\n\n Reply  1 like April 29, 2023 at 8:08 PM\nPrusa MK3/S/S+\n7\nSynyster1911\n@Synyster1911_585300\n\nI'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong but i've printed this whole sword in abs and every time I even start to lift the sword with any sort of velocity, my handle breaks off at the layers.

Sounds like it could be an issue with your layer adhesion. You might want to turn your print temp up to the high end of the temperature range of the filament you're using. Also, turning print speeds down is a common way to improve layer adhesion. I'm no expert when it comes to print settings, but hopefully these changes will get you a stronger result.\n\n Reply  April 25, 2023 at 9:53 AM\n19\nguyish1\n@guyish1\n\nfrickin sweet\n\n Reply  1 like April 18, 2023 at 2:46 PM\nEnder 3 Pro\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@guyish1 Looks great!\n\n Reply  April 18, 2023 at 2:46 PM\n11\nKazukiUchiha\n@KazukiUchiha_745839\n\nI have a question bevor printing this awesome model:\nDo you lay down the models in the slicer or do you print them standing? with support? without? or just .stl in slicer and go?\n\n Reply  1 like April 18, 2023 at 6:26 AM\nView 4 more comments\n11\nKazukiUchiha\n@KazukiUchiha_745839\n\n@Popandsicle thx!

I used ordinary Hatchbox PLA for the hilt and Protopasta Iron PLA for the blade. They look really nice. The seams between the blade pieces are noticeable, but not much to be done about that (short of buying an XL, of course).\n\nThis model is excellent, with two exceptions:\n\n1) Friction-fitting wasn't really adequate for me. I'm going to need to superglue some of the key parts to hold the whole model together, including the male / insert parts of the blade pieces.\n\n2) The guard anchor pins are horribly designed. They absolutely do not fit into the slots in the hilt - they are both too tall and too thick. Trying to jam them into the holes causes them to break after partial insertion. With good luck, you can pry them out with pliers; without good luck, you'll need to *completely disassemble* the blade to pry out the remnants of the broken guard pin, and maybe reprint the blade joiner.\n\nIt is bizarre that this one component is so poorly designed, compared with every other component of this model. It isn't even orthogonally laid out (the model is skewed about 4 degrees from normal) or bilaterally symmetrical (the pin part meets the arrowhead part kind of off-center).\n\nI've printed these pins about 20 times, trying to get the right adjustments to make it work. My best bet is to import the model into Tinkercad and shave 2.8mm off of the height of the pin, and 0.2mm off of its width. That leads to a pin that inserts reasonably well, including scaling to all three variations that I printed. It isn't exactly a firm insert, but "firm" risks the breakage that I noted above and I don't want to risk it any more.\n\n Reply  1 like April 11, 2023 at 7:13 PM\nS\n12\nsirdirk\n@sirdirk\n\nPrinted in PETG.

That leads me to believe their might be a slicer setting that can help, but I'm not sure what it might be. Also, that version of the sword with looser tolerances is actually currently only 1 piece.

As you can imagine ot makes a lot of problems and makes a lot of mess.\nNow i have tested my printer (Ender 3S1), printed different models before and after the failed attempts at printing this model, and it came out perfectly. I have even cleaned the nozzle (thought it might be jammed). So its ≈°roblem neither with my printer nor filament i using (testing "Owl filament" from Germany)\nI have also tried printing diferent version of the model, changing some parametars, tried diferent model (blade piece 5) and same failure happened.\nAny advice what to try will be appreciated.

Printed the blade in luminous blue. Assembly was generally intuitive, and (aside from some tiny footprint islands on the side guards, which are pretty risky adhesion wise) print geometry was really conscientious.\n\nFits were challenging even on a prusa - that may come down to my 0.6mm nozzle, but either way the blade holder and the other diamond piece were especially rough. Took a lot of sanding and a mallet to get the fit.\n\nI made. everything with 2 to 4 walls (again,0.6 nozzle) and the prints came out quite sturdy. The thing feels solid in my hands, impressively so, though there's a wobble at the blade. Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if there was a single nut/screw under the gold caps to tighten everything down.\n\nOverall, great work. Very happy to have searched "printables master sword" and found something so suitable.

Very well designed. The only part I struggled with was the pins which go above the handle. It was too tight of a fit and they would break when trying to push them in, so I left them off. All the other pieces went together perfectly. Doesn't ruin the function of the sword.

I am having a continual issue with this model (which I LOVE and want so badly to work). I've printed 9 peices so far testing all sorts of things to resolve the issue. However when the blade peices go from the blade to the attachment point I get massive forces against the blade that cause it to shift. This then leads to the hot end colliding with the blade. At first I thought my issue was adhesion so I used the adhesion assist, then went to a glass bed with gluestick and Adhesion assist. And in a last ditch effort I used epoxy on a old glass plate to guarantee it wasn't adhesion. The hot end knocked off my glass plate retaining clips but the model never moved, and yet still caused the issue. (Yes one of the peices had an under extrusion problem, that was later fixed)\n\nI have tried multiple slicers at this point (and a few versions of the same slicer). I also assumed it was an issue with my Z axis motor, however the issue occurs on both the Piece 2 (at 130mm) and on peices 3, 4, 5 (at 150mm).\n\nWould someone be willing to share a Gcode of peices2, 3, 4,5? I have all the rest printed already and am going half mad at this point.

It‚Äôs always possible it‚Äôs something on the printer but I‚Äôve tried to rule out as many things as I can. For example I don‚Äôt have issue printing objects taller then these parts, and the error occurs on both piece 2 and pieces 3/4/5 both at the point where the connector begins to be printed. But those are at different heights.\n\nAt first I assumed my z axis was off, or was slipping. Hence why I tried some towers up to 220mm and also switched from piece 2 (after 4 failed attempts) to pieces 3/4/5.\n\nWatching the operation it seems that the print head is trying to go into the center of the sword to try and build the first layer of the attachment. This doesn‚Äôt actually fit the print head causing it to crush down on the part and shift it. So I assumed slicer errors. But I‚Äôve now done the Prusa slicer, cura 4.3 and cura 5.0 with the same results.\n\nMy printer is not direct drive, it‚Äôs still Bowden, so the Gcode would not work for my printer but I just want to go down the code line by line to see what happens at that specific moment in someone else‚Äôs slicer.\n\nAt the moment I lopped off the attachments and have printed the blade parts fine (last one will be done in 4 hours. I am then designing Female to female connectors adaptors to connect the blades together, so I will make the print work, but man is it driving me crazy.\n\n Reply  2 likes September 9, 2022 at 10:32 AM\n10\nJoshua Ham\n@JoshuaHam_238477\n\n@Deonnyn_346932 It seems you have an issue with your printer.

Printed on my Mini+ using Printbed and Overture PLA at .15 with 15% infill. The thought put into the crossguard and grip is fantastic and was super easy and fun to assemble.\n\nThe blade was a little tricky. Started with the adhesion assisted files, but noticed the edges were curling and pulling away from the bed. I corrected this by using the standard blade files and adding my own inner/outer brim and helper discs on the edges. After these adjustments printing the blade pieces was a breeze.\n\nAssembling the blade required filing the edges of the joins to get the pieces to fit without a struggle. I couldn't fully join blade pieces 1 and 2, but the gap is small and I can live with it. Also had to trim down the guard pins because they turned out too thick to fit easily into their slots.\n\nAs for the final result, definitely not a piece you would swing around, since you can feel the crossguard and grip flex against the weight of the full blade.\n\nDespite my nitpicks, which are minor and attribute solely to me and my lack of experience printing such a large piece needing assembly, this is a wonderfully engineered design and I hope you have a long list of dream swords to design and share with us in the future.\n\n Reply  2 likes August 24, 2022 at 3:18 PM\nPrusa MINI / MINI+\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@margintomargin Thanks so much for sharing!

I would suggest filling and sanding before painting though. I like to use a mixture of Glazing and Spot putty mixed with acetone so you can more or less paint it on. Then you let it dry (which it does quickly), sand it, with different grits, until its smooth and then paint. I guess you could just paint the 3d print but you will see all the layer lines.

I would love to see a wall hangar or a base for it to stick into for display. Creator did an amazing job with these files. I recommend the adhesion assisted versions where possible. It was super easy to print. I ran all the blade pieces together on one plate on the mini.\n\n Reply  2 likes August 18, 2022 at 11:38 AM\nPrusa MINI / MINI+\nView one more comment\n17\nThe Avg Joe\n@TheAvgJoe\n\n@Popandsicle I was just coming to ask if you could make like a wall mount type holder so I can hang it on the wall blade down. I might try to make my own, and if i do ill post it, but I am still very VERY early in my modeling capabilities. They're pretty much nonexistant but I REALLY want to learn. I have fusion but I cant figure it out so I mostly just tinkercad. This is an awesome model. My wife is just as exicted for me to print. Its made us want to get a Zelda game for our kids to play!\n\n Reply  1 like August 20, 2022 at 12:42 PM\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\nReally nice work! I‚Äôm definitely going to make a base or mount for it, sooner than later. I wanted to design a game accurate wall display, but then I realized the ones from the game are like 20‚Äù x 50‚Äù. I‚Äôm gonna design something that only holds onto the hilt, and let‚Äôs the blade hang.\n\n Reply  2 likes August 18, 2022 at 3:32 PM\n20\nbykim\n@bykim\n\nAmazing! Really enjoyed printing and putting this together. I didn't realize how big it would be when put together (against a door for scale). I printed it with a 0.6mm nozzle (arachne) at 0.3 layer height. Some pieces were a pretty tight fit and required tools but pleasantly surprised how everything went together by friction fit. Highly recommend the adhesion assisted version of the cross guard pieces.

It's a lot easier to eyeball the length of one piece compared to the next than it is the thickness.\n\n Reply  1 like August 17, 2022 at 3:33 PM\nView 3 more comments\n11\nqwertymodo\n@qwertymodo_250505\n\n@Popandsicle Also, the press-fit on the blade is way too tight, I spent 3 hours filing down the parts just to get them to fit, only to have one piece still too tight, unable to fully assemble the joint but also unable to remove it, and basically destroyed a 30 hour print. The blade, at least, needs to be more toleranced for a glue joint.\n\n Reply  1 like August 18, 2022 at 4:26 PM\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@qwertymodo_250505 Definitely a good idea. It‚Äôs easy enough to tell the pieces apart by lining up their ends, but it‚Äôd be nice to be able to tel them apart more easily. I‚Äôm gonna start a list of changes to make for an upgraded version, definitely putting that on the list!\n\n Reply  August 17, 2022 at 6:04 PM\n12\nOverlee Engineered\n@OverleeEnginee\n\nWould it be possible to blunt the two sharp points on the cross-guards, by doing something like stretching those corners up a few millimeters?\nIf they were stretched straight up on the z-axis, the profile would still look good, but it would be a little less painful when stabbing into your skin.\n(Picture is my attempt to illustrate the idea)\n\n Reply  1 like August 17, 2022 at 2:41 AM\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@OverleeEnginee Weird. I replied to this yesterday, but now my reply is gone, guessing I never hit ‚Äòpost‚Äô. Anyway, that‚Äôs a great suggestion. Maybe I‚Äôll make an alternative version of the hilt that‚Äôs not so sharp. I don‚Äôt want to alter the design for people planning on just having the sword on display, but I also don‚Äôt want those planning on cosplaying, or practicing their swordsmanship drawing blood, not their own at least. Thanks for the idea!\n\n Reply  August 18, 2022 at 3:36 PM\nI\n3\nIllinois Yooper\n@IllinoisYoope_331394\n\nThis is incredibly well done!

If I were to make the pieces much taller, you'd likely have to bring down the print speed. I can make the parts if you want to give it a go though. Let me know how tall you can print.\n\nYou gave me a good idea by the way, I should make an alternate version of the blade that can be printed on a belt printer!\n\n Reply  August 16, 2022 at 8:36 AM\n10\nStuffIPrinted\n@StuffIPrinted\n\nCan anyone recommend any print settings for this?

Printed everything at 15% infill, except for the Guard Pins, which I printed at 100% infill just to be safe. Printed most parts with a .2 mm layer height as well, and was happy with the result. Although not necessary, the two parts that would benefit the most from a .1 mm layer height would be the Cross Guard Sides, due to their print orientation. Also, if you print the Cross Guard Sides on your mini, You'll want to drop the "Distance from brim/object" from 2 mm to 1 mm, otherwise your toolpath will fall outside the print area. Hope this helped!\n\n Reply  1 like August 15, 2022 at 11:34 AM\n9\nabouchard55\n@abouchard55_336458\n\nFfs, turns out I'm waiting on an order of PLA containing exactly Purple, Red, Gold and Silver, so what choice do I have but to print this ??!?\n\n Reply  1 like August 15, 2022 at 10:01 AM\n15\nPopandsicle\n@Popandsicle\n\n@abouchard55_336458 Aye!

If you print it, please share it when it's done, I'd love to see it! A Forest Dwellers Sword made out of real wood would be an awesome project! My biggest suggestion for a project like that would be to check out https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/\n\nThey have pages for all of the items in the games, and even the 3D assets from the games. They're super low poly, but they're perfect for extracting dimensions to get your proportions as close to accurate as possible.
