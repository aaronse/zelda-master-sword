## History

2025-10-11 
- Looking for a glow in dark HS TPU.  Maybe Overture's Luminous Blue for sword, not sure if it glows, asked Overture folks/community  https://discord.com/channels/1142991509570990120/1143235138382221344/1426621513716596760
- Feedback comments call out that the model has tight tolerances, some struggle to assemble.  So, haven't calibrated my printer in a while, so kicking off a cali-lantern calibration print...
